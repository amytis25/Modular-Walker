Abstract

This project presents the design and analysis of a Modular Walker robot developed to support aging-in-place living. This transformer robot features a modular, self-configurable system that transforms into different modes—walking support, table, and seating—to assist elderly individuals in everyday tasks. Equipped with linear actuators, a call system, and docking capabilities, the design promotes safety, autonomy, and usability. The report outlines the design concept, mechanical analysis, actuation system, and integration within a home environment.
Introduction
The rising elderly population poses challenges for independent living. Robotic systems offer innovative solutions to enhance autonomy and reduce social isolation. This project proposes a transformer robotic system—the Modular Walker—targeted at elderly users who require assistance with mobility, eating, and transitioning between sitting and standing.
Existing Products:
Standard walkers lack dynamic support or smart features.
Sit-to-stand lift chairs offer seating assistance but lack mobility.
Robotic assistants like ElliQ and mobile tables are single-purpose.
Our design combines and extends these functionalities through a reconfigurable robotic system.
